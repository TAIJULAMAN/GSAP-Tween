### **What's a Tween?**

A [**Tween**](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween) is what does all the animation work - think of it like a **high-performance property setter**. You feed in targets (the objects you want to animate), a duration, and any properties you want it to animate and then when the Tween's playhead moves to a new position, figures out what the property values should be at that point applies them accordingly.

### **Common methods for creating a Tween:**
